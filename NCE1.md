## Notes

is this your handbag?  关键句  一般疑问句，用升调读

Pardon  意思是重复一遍，i beg your pardon?  自带sorry的意思

handbag  发音时，***两个爆破音连接在一起时，前者不发音***  han(d)bag 
[爆破音到底怎么爆]([爆破音到底怎么爆？ - 知乎 (zhihu.com)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/150521604))：有6个爆破音，它们是清辅音的爆破音/p/ /t/ /k/，浊辅音的爆破音/b/ /d/ /ɡ/.

it is 由于 it 以辅音结尾 is 以元音开头， 此时要发生辅元音连读 i-tis 
[连读发音|辅音连接元音：你知道turn it off 连读怎么发音吗？ - 知乎 (zhihu.com)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/24699260)
thank you very much  可以更加强调  thanks a lot

# Which book?

## Answer
He wants the red book.
## Notes

which book? 那本书 完整表达：which book do you want? 还有 this one?  do you want this one? no, not that one  no, i don't want that one.

this one? one 是不定代词，代替上文的 a book, 由复数形式ones，也可以前面加定语， this red one？

人称代词的主格和宾格形式：
i-me you-you he-him she-her it-it one-one we-us you-you they-them

large-big
large主要指的是物理量上的大，体积、数量、形状上的大，是small的反义词，形容人时是个子高大。
big所表示的大是不仅体积大而且很重，一个 a large box 未必 big，修饰人时，指的是大人物。

small-little
small指的是物理量上的少，是large的反义词，没有感情色彩
little有小而可爱的感情色彩，big的反义词

# Carol's shopping list
2023-09-08 10:50

## Answer

She isn't going to buy any beer and wine.
## Notes

make a shopping list 写一张采购物品的清单

a lot of  许多，一般用于肯定句，可数名词不可数名词都可以用

We haven't got any meat at all. 我们一点肉都没了
have get = have 有
haven't get = don't have 没有  前者口语更常用
at all 用于否定句， 强调，丝毫、一点

many 和 much  many后跟可数名词，much则跟不可数，主要用于疑问句和否定句

And I'm not going to get any. 不过我不打算买，这个get  与 buy同义

must / need  need 也可以做助动词，常用于否定句和疑问句。要比must强度差很多
Need i make a appointment? 我需要约一下时间吗
You need not hurry. 你不必太匆忙

# Roast beef and potatoes

## Answer
Because she makes a same dinner that is the same as their lunch
Because she has cook the same food for dinner as the men ate for lunch 
## Notes

have 后面接名词或者名词性短语有从事、进行的意思，如 have a bath/have a cigarette/have a glass if whisky/have dinner/have lunch

have  可以代替常用动词，表示 eat enjoy experience drink take 等意义 这里have是行为动词，可以有各种时态。不像作为有时，只有现在时态，

Sam's here. 萨姆来了

breakfast/lunch/supper/dinner/meal  supper常指的是在晚上在家吃的便餐，而dinner有正餐的意思。三餐统称meal

现在完成时，后面不接时间状语，当强调过去某一时刻发生时，用一般过去时

由have的现在式和动词的过去分构成，动词的过去分词常和动词过去式一致，少量不一致。

have been to ... 到过某地，到过那里则是 have been there. have been to the park/have been to work. 需要定冠词the时需要加上

What's on? 上演什么电影

all the time. 始终 一直

ever 从来/曾经/任何时候  常在否定句、疑问句中
Have you ever been there? 你去过哪里吗？
never 从未/从无
I’ve never been there. 我从来没去过

have gone 和 have been.
have been, 表示去过，但是现在不在那里了。
have gone, 表示已经去某地了，现在在那个地方或者在去的路上。

They believe they have l lot of time so they go to a bar which is next door to the station and have a drink. Then they miss the next train.

# Ow!
2023-09-15 10:48

## Answer
No, he mustn't. The doctor will come to his home and see him.
## Notes

Ow 表示突然的疼痛

fell downstairs 从楼梯上掉下来，这里 downstairs 是副词。

Try and stand up. 尝试站起来

Let me help you.

the doctor says that he will come at once. 间接引语，英语中把某人的话告诉另一个人要用间接引语，间接引语没有引号，通常由that引导。
时态问题：如果间接引语的引述动词是现在时，那么其后的时态通常与口头陈述句时态相同，在转述刚说完的话时就是这样

get up 站起来、起床

be afraid that/be sure that 恐怕/肯定、认为，that在口语中常省略

宾语从句P201L：在句子中作宾语，一般用that引导，但在口语中经常省略。可用在say/think/believe/hope/know/understand/suppose 等动词后。也可用在一些表达感情的形容词后如afraid/sure/sorry/glad等单词后

Have you hurt yourself? 你伤到你自己了吗？ hurt -> hurt -> hurt
I think that I've hurt my back. 我想我摔伤了我的背
hurt后跟反身代词或者一个身体部位 back/arm/leg/waist腰/ankle脚踝
my back hurts. 我的后背很疼

slip -> slipped -> slipped

fall -> fell -> fallen 用法：[fall in Simplified Chinese - Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english-chinese-simplified/fall)

lift the box 搬箱子

try and stand up. 试着站起来，像是try to stand up. 类似还有come/go。

He doesn't say very much, does he? 附加反义疑问句，前句陈述句后句简略问句，两句谓语在时态人称和数上都要一致，用于确定自己的判断，或者反应愤怒惊讶等感情，前句肯定后句就要否定。回答像是否定疑问句是对事实的回答, 在前句是否定形式下翻译时也也可能相反
He doesn't say very much, does he?  他没写很多呀，是吧？
No, he doesn't. 是的，没写很多
Yes, he does. 不，他写了不少
She went to Pairs last month, didn't she? 她上周去巴黎了，不是吗？
Yes, she did.  是的她去了
No, she didn't. 不她没去


直接引语和间接引语，直接引语就是用引号直接引用说话者的话，带标点都在引号内，间接引语是将话作为宾语从句带入，间接引语从句动词时态与主句一致，主要是一般现在时、现在进行时、现在完成时和将来时
直接引语改为间接引语主要体现在由于人称变化导致的谓语动词变化。

I can't hear you. hear强调结果，是否能听到吗，listen 强调动作，listen to me.

Sandra was called to the office by the boss due to mistakes in her work. 
这里的mistakes过度限定了，duo to her mistakes 或者 duo to mistakes in her work.

There were numerous errors in the letter she had typed.
numerous 大量的

# It's too small
2023-09-19 11:36

## Answer
She wants a blue dress in her size.
## Notes

Madam 对女士的尊称，服务行业常用

would you like ... 你愿意...吗，表示委婉的请求或者建议
would you like to try it? 你想试穿一下吗？这里还可以时try it on/try on the dress
would you like a glass of water? 你想来杯水吗，可以直接跟名词。

Its smaller than the blue one. 他比那套蓝色的小。
在英文中，我们把一个人或者物与另一个人或物进行比较时，就要用形容词比较级。比较级在双反都存在时们就必须在比较级后面加上than，有时在上下文明确时，比较级也可以独立存在
比较级和最高级的变形
+ 大多数单音节形容词是在单词后+er/est
+ 单音节只有一个元音字母，末尾是辅音字母时，末尾辅音字母双写后+er/est
+ 单音节以e结尾时+r/st
+ 有些双音节形容词以y结尾，且y前时一个辅音字母，需要变y -> i再+er/est
+ 不规则变形
	+ good -> better  -> best
	+ bad -> worse -> worst

The job suit him. 这份工作很适合他。 

could you ... 表示请求 比can更委婉。

This is the largest dress in the shop. 这是店里最大的裙子了。
这里使用形容词的最高级，一般是在形容词后+est，并且与定冠词the连用，表示与一个以上的人或者物进行比较
The green dress is the smallest dress in the shop/of them all/I've even seen.

be in fashion 时髦、流行

as well 同时、也，通常用于句末，与too一样常用于肯定句，否定句用either。

Like that one. 像那件那样的。

bad -> worse -> worst worse worst worse worst 

less than that 比那少点

what a pity 多遗憾啊！常用 what a +可数名词或者 what 不可数名词表示感叹

just a little 就来一点
just very little 就一点点
just much 多来点

I think there are a few in that box. 我认为盒子里还有几根香烟
I think there are very few in that box. 更少的量
I think there are many in that box. 多点了

One and a half teaspoonfuls, please 一勺半
teaspoonfuls 一茶匙的量 handful 一把

may i ... 表示请求

It doesn't matter. 没关系

I have even seen. 我所见过的，定语从句

省略 more than you've 比你的多点，这里省略里got
I’ve got the most 这里省略后名词，最高级后通常会省略名词

名词的数和修饰词，可数名词的多少用many/few,不可数用much/little
many/much -> more -> most 
little -> less -> least

Shall I make some coffee? 这里some，在征求意见时疑问句可以用。

instead 副词代替，
Peter was ill, so I went instead.
Let's play cards instead of watching TV. 这里的watching 是因为 instead of 是介词短语，后面跟名词或者相当于名词的动名词  

That's very good advice! 建议不可数  a piece of advice 一条建议
What good advice! 

(a) few 以及(a) little 用法
few用于可数名词，little用于不可数名词，其次在没有a时表示否定，没有一点的意思，有a时表示有一点。 在表示否定式常用very连用，very few 几乎一点也没

buy ... on instalments 分期买...

... and then fourteen pounds a month for three years. 然后每月付14英镑，持续三年。

We've got no time. 我们一点时间也没有。
这里的no 实际上代替了not any 如 We haven't got any tome. 但是比any更强烈，no后可以跟任何名词
None 这是代替 no+noun

I have got none. 我没有，这里的none 在上下文里可能代指具体的物品，也可以与可数名词连用，none of our passengers can change this note.  乘客里没人能找开
There is none. 这没什么东西
I bought none. 我没买什么

Neither can I/So have I 当有人说了一句否定/肯定的话时，其否定内容也适合你时，可以简略回答，注意主语和动词顺序
so/neither 引导的简短回答，必须倒装，且必须和前句时态一致

# A true story
2023-09-21 15:31

## Answer

Henry, George's parrot.
## Notes

It happened to a friend of mine a year ago.  一年前，发生在我朋友身上的一件事
a friend of mine.我的朋友之一，相比于 one of my friends 前者更亲切。

climb into 爬进
enter house 进入房子
run away 逃走、逃避
what's up 什么事
go back to sleep 继续睡觉
happen to  发生在...身上


run away as quickly as they could. as quickly as they could是状语，第一个as是副词，第二个as是连词，引导比较状语从句，could后省略了run，

he called, 这里的he是值得鹦鹉，拟人了

after they had entered the house, they went into the dining room. 这里after they had entered the house 是时间状语从句，强调了进餐厅时已经进屋了，用了过去完成时

过去完成时：had+动词过去分词，常与already/ever/for+时间段/just/never连用，通常为了突出事件发生的先后顺序

after I finished, I went home. 这个不用特别适用过去完成时，通过意思也能分辨先后

例句： We had had dinner before they arrived. 他们到之前我们就吃了晚饭了。

‘What's up? What's up?' someone called. 有人说到发生什么事了。

# The man in a hat

## Answer

Because he was in a hat when he bought the dictionaries, But now he isn't in a hat.
## Notes

forget -> forgot -> forgotten

定语从句的关系代词 that/who/which/whom，定语从句就像形容词一样起修饰作用，但位于所修饰的名词之后，定语从句由关系词引导，紧跟在它所修饰的成分之后，关系代词代指从句的主语或者宾语。
The lady who is standing behind the counter.
The lady who is standing behind the counter served me.

The man who I served.
The man who I served was wearing a hat.
这里The man 在定语从句中是宾语，所以应该用whom，但是口语中常常就用who

But I forget to take them with me. 但是我忘记带走他们了。

Put it on. 戴上他们。

must/have to/needn't
have to/must  不得不，必须，强调客观，由于什么原因必须，而must强调主观, 在肯定句中一般也可以互换，在时态上，must一般表达现在时的必须，而have还可以表达将来、过去的必须
如果用must来提问，则否定只能用needn't回答，因为mustn’t表示禁止，needn't/don't have to 都可以表达不必要

Where do you think you are?  do you think 是特殊疑问句中的插入语，用来询问见解或者看法，这里由于插入语已经是疑问结构了，所以 you are结构不能再对调了。用来做插入有的还有I hope/ I think/ I afraid/you know等，插入语位于句尾或者句中，有时也在疑问句中。
What do you think you are doing?
Which book do you think is more interesting?

must have been doing something 一定是在做某事，表示对过去进行的事进行猜测，否定是can't have been doing.

That's why I didn't see the sign. 所以我才没看到那牌子。这里why I didn't see the sign是表语，以why引导的从句解释原因

you'd better take my advice 你最好还是听从我的劝告把。take one's advice.
you'd better not do it again. 你最好下次别做 had better do.
had better 语气强于should， 常用于威胁、告诫和催促。

make myself beautiful. 把自己打扮漂亮

be dressed in. 被动

被动语态，与主动语态相对，在被动语态中，主语是动作的承受者。熟练使用被动语态，可以避免使用不明意义的主语。
一般现在时：is/am/are + 动词过去分词
一般过去时：was/were + 动词过去分词
